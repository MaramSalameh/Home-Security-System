# Home-Security-System
A simplified home security system using a Raspberry Pi, this system will monitor a homeâ€™s surroundings and allow the user to lock or 
unlock their doors using a cellphone or computer. The system includes a motion sensor that will be placed on the door to 
trigger a camera when necessary, a piezoelectric sensor to ensure the door is opened after the proper authorization, 
and a hall effect sensor to monitor whether the door is open or shut
